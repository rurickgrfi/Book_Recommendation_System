# Book Recommendation System

Project Overview
---
Discovering the perfect book that aligns with our personal preferences can be challenging, especially for those who are not regular readers. In my capstone project, I have chosen to address this issue by building a book recommendation system. By developing this tool, I aim to predict and suggest books that individuals would enjoy reading, making the process of book selection easier and more personalized.

My capstone project aims to create a powerful book recommendation system that enhances the book discovery process for users. By utilizing data processing, and various recommendation techniques, I strive to provide tailored book suggestions that align with individual preferences, ultimately enriching the reading experience and fostering a love for books.

Dataset

To address this challenge, my capstone utilize the [Amazon Books Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohamedbakhet/amazon-books-reviews) dataset, available on Kaggle.com, which consists of two files: book details and user reviews. The book details file, constructed using the Google Books API, contains information on a vast collection of 212,404 unique books. On the other hand, the user reviews file contains feedback from over 3 million users, gathered from the Amazon review dataset spanning from May 1996 to July 2014.
